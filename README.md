# Knn-algorithm-implementation-using-sklearn
implement knn algorithm on iris dataset using sklearn(python)
Scikit-learn is probably the most useful library for machine learning in Python. The sklearn library contains a lot of efficient tools for machine learning and statistical modeling including classification, regression, clustering and dimensionality reduction.
So using sklearn i analyse knn algorithm on one datatset iris specially help for data mining anthusiast.
